This script is designed for object detection in video streams using the YOLOv5 model. 
It captures video frames, and processes them to detect objects. 
The script uses multi-threading to improve performance by simultaneously reading frames andperforming object detection. 
Additionally, it listens for a keyboard interrupt (ESC key) to gracefully terminate the process.
Uses supervision module to track objects and perform counting
